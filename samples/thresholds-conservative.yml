# Conservative Threshold Configuration for .NET to AWS NoSQL Migration Analyzer
# 
# This configuration uses strict thresholds to identify only the most obvious
# migration candidates. Ideal for production systems where you want high
# confidence in recommendations. May miss some valid candidates.

# Query Pattern Analysis Thresholds
# These control when entities are considered frequently accessed together

# Minimum frequency for entities to be considered "always loaded together"
# Conservative: 20 (very strong pattern required)
always_loaded_together_frequency_threshold: 20

# Minimum total access frequency for an entity to be considered a candidate
# Conservative: 25 (only highly accessed entities)
total_access_frequency_threshold: 25

# Minimum frequency for medium-priority analysis with related entities
# Conservative: 10 (significant usage required)
medium_frequency_threshold: 10

# Minimum count of complex eager loading queries to be considered a candidate
# Conservative: 5 (multiple complex patterns needed)
complex_eager_loading_frequency_threshold: 5

# Production Metrics Thresholds
# These apply when Query Store production data is available

# Minimum execution count to be considered high production usage
# Conservative: 10000 (significant production volume)
high_production_usage_threshold: 10000

# Minimum co-access count to indicate strong production relationships
# Conservative: 1000 (very strong production relationship)
production_co_access_threshold: 1000

# Minimum co-access count for including entities as related
# Conservative: 500 (clear production relationship)
related_entity_co_access_threshold: 500

# Minimum co-access count for scoring bonus points
# Conservative: 1000 (matches production_co_access_threshold)
co_access_scoring_threshold: 1000

# Read/Write Ratio Thresholds
# These identify read-heavy patterns suitable for denormalization

# Minimum read/write ratio to be considered "read-heavy"
# Conservative: 10.0 (strongly read-dominated)
read_heavy_ratio_threshold: 10.0

# Medium read/write ratio for scoring
# Conservative: 5.0 (clearly read-heavy)
medium_read_ratio_threshold: 5.0

# Entity Analysis Thresholds

# Minimum read count required before analyzing read/write ratios
# Conservative: 10 (sufficient data for meaningful ratio)
min_read_count_for_ratio_analysis: 10
