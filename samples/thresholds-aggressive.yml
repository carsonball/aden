# Aggressive Threshold Configuration for .NET to AWS NoSQL Migration Analyzer
# 
# This configuration uses more sensitive thresholds to identify more migration
# candidates. Useful for greenfield projects or when you want to maximize
# NoSQL adoption. May result in more false positives.

# Production Metrics Thresholds
# These apply when Query Store production data is available

# Minimum execution count to be considered high production usage
# Aggressive: 10 (very low production threshold)
high_production_usage_threshold: 10

# Minimum co-access count to indicate strong production relationships
# Aggressive: 5 (minimal co-access required)
production_co_access_threshold: 5

# Minimum co-access count for including entities as related
# Aggressive: 2 (very sensitive relationship detection)
related_entity_co_access_threshold: 2

# Minimum co-access count for scoring bonus points
# Aggressive: 5 (matches production_co_access_threshold)
co_access_scoring_threshold: 5

# Read/Write Ratio Thresholds
# These identify read-heavy patterns suitable for denormalization

# Minimum read/write ratio to be considered "read-heavy"
# Aggressive: 1.5 (slight read bias is enough)
read_heavy_ratio_threshold: 1.5

# Medium read/write ratio for scoring
# Aggressive: 1.2 (nearly balanced is acceptable)
medium_read_ratio_threshold: 1.2

# Entity Analysis Thresholds

# Minimum read count required before analyzing read/write ratios
# Aggressive: 1 (analyze everything with reads)
min_read_count_for_ratio_analysis: 1

# Performance Analysis Thresholds

# Duration threshold in milliseconds for identifying slow queries
# Aggressive: 50.0 (catch even moderately slow queries)
slow_query_duration_threshold_ms: 50.0
