## Detailed Recommendations

### 1. Customer â†’ Amazon DynamoDB

#### Migration Details

- **Table/Collection Name:** `CustomerData`

#### Key Design

**Partition Key:**
- Attribute: `customerId`
- Type: S
- Examples: CUST123, CUST456

**Sort Key:**
- Attribute: `entityType#timestamp`
- Type: S
- Examples: PROFILE#2024-01-15, ORDER#2024-01-16

#### Global Secondary Indexes

- **EmailIndex**
  - Partition Key: `email`
  - Sort Key: `customerId`
  - Purpose: Query customers by email

#### Design Rationale

**Denormalization Strategy:** Single-table design combining Customer with frequently co-accessed Order and OrderItem entities based on 85% of co-access patterns

**Key Design Justification:** CustomerId as partition key enables efficient customer lookups; composite sort key with entityType allows storing multiple entity types while maintaining query efficiency

**Relationship Handling:** 1:N Customer-Order relationship preserved through sort key design; Order items embedded as nested documents to reduce joins

**Performance Optimizations:** GSI on email optimizes customer lookup pattern; sparse index on orderStatus reduces scan costs for order queries

**Access Pattern Analysis:** Analysis shows 95% of queries retrieve customer with recent orders, supporting single-table design. Read-heavy workload (10:1) favors denormalization

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Single table reduces join complexity but increases item size
- Denormalization improves read performance but requires careful update orchestration
- GSI costs offset by elimination of join operations

### 2. CustomerProfile â†’ Amazon DynamoDB

#### Migration Details

- **Table/Collection Name:** `ApplicationData`

#### Key Design

**Partition Key:**
- Attribute: `customerId`
- Type: S
- Examples: CUST789, CUST101

**Sort Key:**
- Attribute: `entityType#timestamp`
- Type: S
- Examples: PROFILE#2024-02-20, PROFILE#2024-02-21

#### Design Rationale

**Denormalization Strategy:** Included in the Customer entity's single-table design to leverage co-access patterns and simplify queries

**Key Design Justification:** Using customerId as partition key for consistent access pattern across Customer and CustomerProfile entities

**Relationship Handling:** Direct relationship with Customer entity is naturally modeled in a single-table design

**Performance Optimizations:** Leveraging the existing CustomerData table design to minimize additional overhead

**Access Pattern Analysis:** Given the high co-access rate with Customer, including CustomerProfile in the same table optimizes for read performance

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Increased complexity in managing single table for multiple entities
- Potential for larger item sizes, but offset by reduced need for joins and separate queries

### 3. Order â†’ Amazon DynamoDB

#### Migration Details

- **Table/Collection Name:** `ApplicationData`

#### Key Design

**Partition Key:**
- Attribute: `customerId`
- Type: S
- Examples: CUST234, CUST567

**Sort Key:**
- Attribute: `entityType#orderId`
- Type: S
- Examples: ORDER#ORD123, ORDER#ORD456

#### Design Rationale

**Denormalization Strategy:** Orders included with Customer in a single-table design to optimize for frequent co-access patterns

**Key Design Justification:** CustomerId as partition key supports efficient retrieval of orders by customer; entityType#orderId sort key enables order-specific queries

**Relationship Handling:** Embedding OrderItems within Order records to minimize read operations and simplify data retrieval

**Performance Optimizations:** Avoiding separate tables for Orders and OrderItems to reduce query complexity and improve read efficiency

**Access Pattern Analysis:** High read-to-write ratio and frequent access with Customer entity justify single-table design

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Potential increase in item size due to embedding OrderItems, but benefits from reduced query complexity
- Single-table design complexity versus ease of access and performance gains

### 4. OrderItem â†’ Amazon DynamoDB

#### Migration Details

- **Table/Collection Name:** `ApplicationData`

#### Key Design

**Partition Key:**
- Attribute: `customerId`
- Type: S
- Examples: CUST890, CUST012

**Sort Key:**
- Attribute: `entityType#orderId#orderItemId`
- Type: S
- Examples: ORDERITEM#ORD123#ITEM456, ORDERITEM#ORD789#ITEM012

#### Design Rationale

**Denormalization Strategy:** Embedding OrderItems within Orders to streamline data retrieval and reduce the need for separate queries

**Key Design Justification:** Composite sort key allows for efficient retrieval of specific OrderItems within an Order

**Relationship Handling:** Maintains the MANY_TO_ONE relationship with Orders within a single table, simplifying data management

**Performance Optimizations:** Reduces the need for separate tables and queries, optimizing for read operations

**Access Pattern Analysis:** Given the integral role of OrderItems in order processing, embedding within Orders supports efficient access

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Increased complexity in item structure, but with significant benefits in query efficiency
- Embedding limits flexibility for OrderItem updates, but aligns with the primary access patterns

### 5. Category â†’ Amazon DynamoDB

#### Migration Details

- **Table/Collection Name:** `ProductData`

#### Key Design

**Partition Key:**
- Attribute: `categoryId`
- Type: S
- Examples: CAT123, CAT456

**Sort Key:**
- Attribute: `entityType#name`
- Type: S
- Examples: CATEGORY#Electronics, CATEGORY#Books

#### Design Rationale

**Denormalization Strategy:** Maintained as a separate entity due to distinct access patterns from core Customer-Order data

**Key Design Justification:** CategoryId as partition key supports direct lookups; entityType#name sort key enables efficient category name queries

**Relationship Handling:** ONE_TO_MANY relationship with Products managed through category references within Product items

**Performance Optimizations:** Separate table optimizes category-specific queries without impacting the performance of the unified Customer-Order table

**Access Pattern Analysis:** Distinct access patterns and lower co-access frequency with Customer and Order entities

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Separate table increases complexity but allows for optimized category management and queries
- Maintains flexibility for category-specific updates and queries without impacting the primary Customer-Order data model

### 6. Product â†’ Amazon DynamoDB

#### Migration Details

- **Table/Collection Name:** `ProductData`

#### Key Design

**Partition Key:**
- Attribute: `productId`
- Type: S
- Examples: PROD123, PROD456

**Sort Key:**
- Attribute: `entityType#category`
- Type: S
- Examples: PRODUCT#Electronics, PRODUCT#Books

#### Design Rationale

**Denormalization Strategy:** Maintained as a separate entity due to distinct access patterns from core Customer-Order data

**Key Design Justification:** ProductId as partition key supports direct lookups; entityType#category sort key enables efficient queries by category

**Relationship Handling:** ONE_TO_MANY relationship with Categories reflected in sort key, facilitating category-based product queries

**Performance Optimizations:** Separate table for Products allows for efficient management and querying of product data without impacting Customer-Order table performance

**Access Pattern Analysis:** Product queries often involve category filtering, justifying a separate table to optimize these access patterns

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Separate table increases complexity but allows for optimized product management and queries
- Maintains flexibility for product-specific updates and queries without impacting the primary Customer-Order data model
