# Default Threshold Configuration for .NET to AWS NoSQL Migration Analyzer
# 
# This file contains discovery-appropriate thresholds designed to identify
# potential NoSQL migration candidates while minimizing false positives.

# Copy this file and customize the values to fit your specific analysis needs.

# Query Pattern Analysis Thresholds
# These control when entities are considered frequently accessed together

# Minimum frequency for entities to be considered "always loaded together"
# Discovery default: 5 (sensitive enough to catch common patterns)
always_loaded_together_frequency_threshold: 5

# Minimum total access frequency for an entity to be considered a candidate
# Discovery default: 8 (balances sensitivity with noise reduction)  
total_access_frequency_threshold: 8

# Minimum frequency for medium-priority analysis with related entities
# Discovery default: 2 (very inclusive for discovery scenarios)
medium_frequency_threshold: 2

# Minimum count of complex eager loading queries to be considered a candidate
# Discovery default: 1 (any complex query pattern detected)
complex_eager_loading_frequency_threshold: 1

# Production Metrics Thresholds
# These apply when Query Store production data is available

# Minimum execution count to be considered high production usage
# Discovery default: 100 (reasonable threshold for production systems)
high_production_usage_threshold: 100

# Minimum co-access count to indicate strong production relationships
# Discovery default: 50 (identifies meaningful co-access patterns)
production_co_access_threshold: 50

# Minimum co-access count for including entities as related
# Discovery default: 15 (sensitive enough for discovery)
related_entity_co_access_threshold: 15

# Minimum co-access count for scoring bonus points
# Discovery default: 50 (consistent with production_co_access_threshold)
co_access_scoring_threshold: 50

# Read/Write Ratio Thresholds
# These identify read-heavy patterns suitable for denormalization

# Minimum read/write ratio to be considered "read-heavy"
# Discovery default: 3.0 (moderately read-heavy patterns)
read_heavy_ratio_threshold: 3.0

# Medium read/write ratio for scoring
# Discovery default: 2.5 (slightly read-favored patterns)
medium_read_ratio_threshold: 2.5

# Entity Analysis Thresholds

# Minimum read count required before analyzing read/write ratios
# Discovery default: 2 (avoid analyzing entities with minimal reads)
min_read_count_for_ratio_analysis: 2

# Performance Analysis Thresholds

# Duration threshold in milliseconds for identifying slow queries
# Discovery default: 100.0 (queries taking more than 100ms are considered slow)
slow_query_duration_threshold_ms: 100.0
