# Conservative Threshold Configuration for .NET to AWS NoSQL Migration Analyzer
# 
# This configuration uses strict thresholds to identify only the most obvious
# migration candidates. Ideal for production systems where you want high
# confidence in recommendations. May miss some valid candidates.

# Production Metrics Thresholds
# These apply when Query Store production data is available

# Minimum execution count to be considered high production usage
# Conservative: 10000 (significant production volume)
high_production_usage_threshold: 10000

# Minimum co-access count to indicate strong production relationships
# Conservative: 1000 (very strong production relationship)
production_co_access_threshold: 1000

# Minimum co-access count for including entities as related
# Conservative: 500 (clear production relationship)
related_entity_co_access_threshold: 500

# Minimum co-access count for scoring bonus points
# Conservative: 1000 (matches production_co_access_threshold)
co_access_scoring_threshold: 1000

# Read/Write Ratio Thresholds
# These identify read-heavy patterns suitable for denormalization

# Minimum read/write ratio to be considered "read-heavy"
# Conservative: 10.0 (strongly read-dominated)
read_heavy_ratio_threshold: 10.0

# Medium read/write ratio for scoring
# Conservative: 5.0 (clearly read-heavy)
medium_read_ratio_threshold: 5.0

# Entity Analysis Thresholds

# Minimum read count required before analyzing read/write ratios
# Conservative: 10 (sufficient data for meaningful ratio)
min_read_count_for_ratio_analysis: 10

# Performance Analysis Thresholds

# Duration threshold in milliseconds for identifying slow queries
# Conservative: 500.0 (only significantly slow queries are flagged)
slow_query_duration_threshold_ms: 500.0
